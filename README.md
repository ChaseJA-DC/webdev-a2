# Early Start

A super simple starter website with automatic light and dark theme.

Features:

- Simple styling and a fully editable main page. If you can edit a word document, you can customize this site!
- Support for using the great Collected Notes app as a Content Management System (CMS) for posts. Publish new posts from your phone.

## Get Started

To launch your own free website with this template, you'll need a GitHub account and a Netlify account.

Once you're all signed up, you can deploy this starter site using this button.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ai-mama/early-start)

This creates a GitHub repository for you with a copy of all the files in this project. To make it your own:

1. Edit [_data/meta.js](_data/meta.js) to use your site's name, description, and to add your name and your X (Twitter) username, if you like.
2. Edit the main page of your site: [content/index.md](content/index.md). You can change, remove, or add to anything you see.

Once you commit (save) your changes on GitHub, Netlify will automatically redeploy your updated site.

### Optional Customization

Change colors and styles in [global.css](assets/global.css).
